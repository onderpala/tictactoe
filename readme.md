## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
python test_tictactoe.py
```


## Roadmap

- Clean up written tests creating a class for every function in my Game class

- Clean up documentation (Maybe I can create --help command)

- Create tests for play_game function

- Append Licansing
